Facial Keypoints Detection is the most challenging task in the field of computer vision
and machine learning. Facial features vary from one individual to another and even for
the same person, there is a lot of discrepancy at different views and angles. The objective
of this task is to predict keypoint positions on face images which can be used as a
building block in several applications, such as:
● tracking faces in images and video
● analysing facial expressions
● detecting dysmorphic facial signs for medical diagnosis
● biometrics / face recognition This is a multi-domain problem.
It has a wide variety of applications. There are two main challenges for facial keypoints
detection, one is that facial features have great variance between different people and
different external factors, the other is that we have to reduce time complexity to achieve
real-time keypoints detection. Link to this Kaggle Competition can be found here. We
chose this topic because this is pretty new and interesting to the both of us. This is our
first project in Computer Vision where we’re employing Neural Networks.
The dataset I use is from Kaggle’s facial keypoints detection competition.
